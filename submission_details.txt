Project Title: MoneyMint - Personal Finance Tracker
Problem Statement: Managing personal finances effectively is often difficult due to scattered data and a lack of visual insights. Individuals struggle to track where their money goes, leading to poor financial decisions.
Solution: I built "Money Manager," a full-stack web application designed to simplify personal finance tracking. It allows users to record daily income and expenses, categorize transactions, and visualize their financial health through dynamic charts.

Key Features:
Transaction Management: Seamlessly add, edit, and delete income/expense records.
Smart Filtering: Filter financial data by frequency (Last 7 days, Month, Year, Custom Range) and category.
Visual Analytics: Interactive charts (Pie/Line graphs) to visualize spending patterns vs. income.
Optimized Performance: Implemented React Lazy Loading to reduce initial load time and enhance user experience.
Responsive Design: Fully responsive UI built with Tailwind CSS for mobile and desktop use.

Tech Stack:
Frontend: React.js, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Recharts
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: MongoDB (Atlas)
